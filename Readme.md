libPLN: a library for efficient Powerlaw Noise generation
==============================================================

Project description
-------------------------------

The library libPLN provides the efficient generation of Powerlaw Noise (PLN).

PLN is noise where the power spectral density of the fractional frequency deviation is proportional to f^alpha.
This type of noise is commonly found in oscillators.
See IEEE 1139 [1] for details on this topic.
Typical values for alpha for quartz oscillators are

* *Random walk noise:* alpha = -2
* *Flicker Frequency Modulation:* alpha = -1
* *White Frequency Modulation:* alpha = 0
* *Flicker Phase Modulation:* alpha = 1
* *White Phase Modulation:* alpha = 2    

PLN is generated by libPLN by filtering white noise with a special filter, using one of two methods:

* the method as described by Kasdin and Walter in [2]
* or a with recursive filter (availabled only for the noise classes random walk, white FM and white PM)

The main purpose for libPLN  is the efficient generation of realistic noise in discrete event simulation (DES).
For this purpose it supports not only the generation of continously sampled noise data, but also the estimation of 
noise values in the future.

Project contents
-------------------------------

The most important project directories are the following:

* `src`: the source code for the libPLN library
* `Documentation`: various documentation like Doxygen files and UML diagrams
* `Tests`: a few simple tests mainly to catch regressions
* `Demos`: a few simple demo programs to demonstrate the usage of libPLN
* `Examples`: implementations of simulated example oscillators 

Demo programs
-------------------------------

The demo programs come with their own readme documents in the respective directories.
 
### SimpleDemo

This is a simple demo program that shows how to request time deviation values from one of the provided example oscillators,
and how the library behaves for different requests.

### PLN_Generator

This is a command line tool that uses libPLN to implement the simulation of continously sampled time deviation values.
For details on its usage, see its Readme and Manual documents.
An example for a generated noise vector is shown in the following image:
